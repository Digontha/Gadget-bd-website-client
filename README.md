Website The project I created is a shop website. A store that carries a variety of band items.
- Firstly, my projector has a login and registration system through which users can login and register.
- Thirdly I have an add product route where the user can then add a product of their choice.
- Fourthly I have a toggle button that clicks Light and dark mode can be done.
- Fifth I have an update route where users can update their products.
